## about this website {#about-this-website}

note: TODO

[mazzaella](https://github.com/emdashii/mazzaella) - code for this website. it's a hugo site, built with org-mode, and hosted on netlify.

fun fact: after each page, if you put _.md or /.org at the end of the url, it will show the raw markdown/org file. like
[[/posts/about-site_.md][this]] or [this](/posts/about-site/.org).
