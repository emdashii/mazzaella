### What is a photometer? {#what-is-a-photometer}

A photometer is a device that measures the transmission of light
                through a liquid, from which you can calculate properties of the
                liquid. The photometer that I designed measures the pH of
                seawater.


### Abstract {#abstract}

Many professional biologists are doing ocean acidification
research, but this requires expensive machinery to monitor pH
levels accurately. This project's goal is to make an accessible
and accurate DIY photometer to measure ocean pH, with the goal
of it being used in high school classrooms. This photometer is
upgraded from a design by Yang et al. in their paper, “Seawater
PH Measurements in the Field: A DIY Photometer with 0.01 Unit PH
Accuracy.” The main improvements involve simplifying the
building process using a custom printed circuit board (PCB),
having clear building instructions and usage procedures, adding
a third LED to make the measurements more accurate, and updating
code to calculate the pH on the device. After testing, this DIY
photometer design successfully meets the +/- 0.01 pH precision,
while being simple and cost effective to build. The total cost
is around $80.
