## create the noose {#create-the-noose}

1.  fold your braided cord in half.

2.  about two thickness of the rope from the middle, split the strands in half, so that there are the same number of strands on either side. (note: the number of strands on each side is important. count them to be sure there are the same number.)

3.  near the end of the longer side, fold the rope in half and poke it through the hold you just made.

4.  continue pulling it through until you are left with a small loop.

5.  you have created the noose. align both ends before starting the next step.


## tie the button knot {#tie-the-button-knot}

1.  it helps a lot if you have a small clamp to hold the rope in place while you work. if not, take some tape and put it around the strands where you want to tie the knot. (note: it is much easier to tie the knot with too much rope and adjust it afterwards. much easier to do that than to tie it in the right spot with just enough rope.)

2.  this is the part of the guide where someone else's instructions will be **much** better. each part of this knot is symmetrical, and these photos show you what it looks like after you do both sides of the symmetrical steps. [these](https://www.animatedknots.com/stopper-loop-knot) are the instructions that i used to learn to tie the button knot.

nothing changed from the above image to the below image other than tightening the knot.

again nothing changed, but see how i opened the middle of the knot to make space for the tails to go down.

after you tuck the tails through those holes and clean up the knot, it will look like this:

here is a photo of the top of the knot, if you tied it correctly.

## burying the tails {#burying-the-tails}

1.  before you do this, tighten the knot. i like to do this by hanging from the soft shackle, or by using pliers to pull each strand of the knot tight.

    {{< figure src="/soft-shackle/bury1.jpg" >}}

2.  when your soft shackle looks like the above image, then you are ready to begin. to do the bury, i use a thin wire wrapped around cardboard.

    {{< figure src="/soft-shackle/bury5.jpg" >}}

3.  thin the ends of the tails. there are many ways to do this, but go about an inch up from the end and cut half the strands. (you can also thin in two places for a more gradual reduction in diameter, which is better to get full strength out of the rope.)

    {{< figure src="/soft-shackle/bury2.jpg" >}}

4.  push open the braid and feed the wire in, around where the wire is in the previous photo. depending on your size of rope, you will need a different distance past the ends of the tails. for this rope i go about an inch past.

    {{< figure src="/soft-shackle/bury3.jpg" >}}

5.  once you fish the wire through, push it out as close to the knot as you can. put the end of one of the tails through the wire, and fold it back on itself.

    {{< figure src="/soft-shackle/bury4.jpg" >}}

6.  bury the tail by pulling the wire (with the tail in the end of it) through the braid and out again. when it comes out, tug on it with pliers to make sure it is all the way in and there is no bunching.
