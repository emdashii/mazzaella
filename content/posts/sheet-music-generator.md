## counterpoint sheet music generator {#counterpoint-sheet-music-generator}

using c++ and lilypond


### What is counterpoint and why does it make a good candidate for using code to generate music? {#what-is-counterpoint-and-why-does-it-make-a-good-candidate-for-using-code-to-generate-music}

Counterpoint is a specific style of music, where one melody is
generated based on the note that came before, using specific
rules. This means that if you can write a melody, the program can
write a counterpoint to go along with it.

melodies cannot do.


## What were the requirements and challenges for this project? {#what-were-the-requirements-and-challenges-for-this-project}


### Writing Music: {#writing-music}

-   Translating music theory to code
-   Saving music notes
-   Using logic to check for errors
-   Deciding which part of the program does what


### Exporting sheet music: {#exporting-sheet-music}

-   Understanding basic music rules
-   Integrating with LilyPond
-   Exporting different lengths
-   Exporting in different keys
-   Exporting with difrferent time signatures


## Proejct details: {#proejct-details}

This program was written in C++, and was designed to export text
that fit the .ly file format. Here is the class hierarchy diagram.

The goal for this project is to build a program that generates
correct two-voice counterpoint.

This project has four distinct parts: a note class, a
class/function that combines all the rules, classes of rules, and
a class/function that outputs a .ly file.


### Key Features {#key-features}

-   User chooses length, time signature, and species type
-   Follows all the rules for counterpoint
-   Outputs a LilyPond file with the generated music


### Assumptions {#assumptions}

-   The users are good actors
-   The user will not want to write counterpoint in a minor key
-   The user cannot choose what specific notes they want

Note: Caleb N. and I worked on this project together.

The code still runs, though there are now build errors. I ran it,
and this is what the program looked like:

{{< figure src="/lilypond/image3.png" >}}

 It created a file, which, once I found it, imports into LilyPond
correctly and plays. You can copy the outputted text and put it
into hacklily.org (also linked below) to see the sheet music. I
generated the first two phrases in style 0, then in style 1, then
style 2, then finally style 0 again.

Here is the first bit
of the output:

I am very impressed that it still runs. It looks like there are
some notes for which the logic may be wrong, given the large jumps
up and down occasionally, and when I listened to it I heard at
least one major second, which I don't think should be there (the
last note in measure five). Still, I haven't looked at this code
in three years, and I'm kinda impressed with my past self. What a
cool project xD

I uploaded all the project files to
[github](https://github.com/emdashii/counterpoint_generator),
as they were being hosted somewhere else, so at least I'll have
a copy of the code.

Here is a bonus image of what the program looked like when it ran:

super impressive xD
