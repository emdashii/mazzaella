## why mazzaella? {#why-mazzaella}

First, what is Mazzaella? Mazzaella is a genus of a species of
seaweed. See [this](https://www.seaweedsofalaska.com/species.asp?SeaweedID=224) article. Why did I choose the domain name
Mazzaella? Because it reminds me of home, the Pacific Northwest.
_Mazzaella splendens_ is a beautiful red seaweed. When you
view it underwater, it shimmers.

The photo above is a picture I took of what I hope is of
_Mazzaella splendens_. It looks similar to it, but the
iridescence did not show up on camera, so I'm not one hundred
percent sure.


## why am I? {#why-am-i}

 I, Elliott Claus, am. I grew up on a small island in the Pacific
Ocean, Orcas Island, WA. I went to college at Walla Walla
University and graduated in 2020 with a Bioengineering degree. I
worked a summer construction job through high school and college,
and for a bit afterwards. I recently moved to Georgia, as I
accepted a junior developer role at AppVizo. I am good at making
things happen while keeping cost, time, and quality in mind. You
can only have two, but I try to optimize as best I can.

For fun, I like to play board games, pickleball, and ride my
electric unicycle. For entertainment, I default to Twitter and
YouTube. For society, I mostly spend time with my family and close
friends.
