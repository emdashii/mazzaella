An experiment in workflow

** What is a split keyboard?

[[/split-keyboard/crkbd.jpg]]

This is a split keyboard. In fact, this is my split keyboard. It is a crkbd corne, which I have programmed a custom keymap for.

** Why would anyone want a split keyboard?

A split keyboard is a significant improvement in ergonomics. Most
keyboards have people's arms twisted in and their fingers at
awkward angles. This position also scrunches people's shoulders
together. When the halves of the keyboard are moved apart, your
shoulders open up. Also, in the ergonomics department, you can
“tent” the keyboard. When people's hands are palms down in front
of them, it puts extra pressure on the forearms. Once you tent the
keyboard, which is to raise the edge in the center, it puts your
hands into a more neutral position. Some people tent their
keyboards so the halves are almost ninety degrees, while others do
more like fifteen through thirty degrees.

The keys on this keyboard are ortholinear, which means they go in
vertical rows. This means that each finger has to travel less
distance and the finger movement is more natural. Also, because
there are fewer keys, a finger only ever has to reach a key that
is one key away from the home row. If your hands never leave the
home row, then you can have a very accurate mental map of where
all the keys are. Part of the design philosophy behind a keyboard
with less keys is that when you have less keys, you don't need to
stretch your fingers to get to any key. This is something I didn't
notice much until I started programming more heavily and was
typing ctrl+shift+arrow keys, parentheses, and function keys a
lot. Each time I had to type a complicated chord (combination of
keys) or move my hands away from the home row, it would take a bit
to reset. Using a split keyboard completely eliminates this.
Through keyboard shortcuts, I can type, edit text, and swap
programs without having to take my hands off the keyboard. I'll
include a non-exhaustive list of useful keyboard shortcuts at the
bottom of this page. The split keyboard isn't quite like a full
fledged vim editor, but it's close. And, when I'm typing and
editing, my hands almost never move. It really feels like magic.

Split keyboards are fun! You can design your own keymap and
layout, and program the LEDs and screens to do exactly what you
want. This allows a ton of creativity and people have come up with
clever keymaps.

Split keyboards allow you to use your thumb more effectively. An
opposable thumb is a genius of engineering, and for input we only
use it to hit the spacebar. Split keyboards often give multiple
keys to the thumb, so that another digit can be used effectively.
This is something that I can't believe I've never thought of
before. Why have my thumbs been so underutilized on all keyboards
before this?

Finally, split keyboards are more portable than full sized
keyboards. This is great when some days I work from home and some
days I go into the office. I can easily transport my keyboard
between places.

** How can you type/program with so few keys?

Aha, this is really the crux of the question. This keyboard uses
layers to easily access every key. In fact, I would argue that
it's easier to type any key than on a 100% keyboard. (Mine is a
40% keyboard.) Everyone already uses at least one layer on any
keyboard, the shift layer. A key will output a lowercase letter,
unless shift is held down or capslock is on. This functionally
doubles the number of characters a keyboard can output. Not
counting shift as a layer, this keyboard has three layers. The
first contains all the letters. The second contains all symbols
and numbers. The third contains all navigation keys and function
keys. With a keyboard like this, you can program as many layers as
you want. Here is a map of my keyboard layers.

[[/split-keyboard/keymap.jpg]]

After only a few weeks, I have almost every key memorized on each
layer. This is way better than on the standard keyboard, where I
always have had to look down to know what symbol I want to type.

This keymap has a few things that I think are really cool. The
first is called
[[https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods][Home Row Mods]].
This allows me to press the windows key, alt, shift, and
control using the keys on the homerow, rather than having to move
my fingers to any keys. If I need to shift a key on my left hand,
I press shift with my right middle finger. If I need to press
shift with my right hand, I hold down my left ring finger. This is
amazing. If you want to know more, click the link above.

The second cool thing is that I have a numpad for my right hand.
Typing numbers on a numpad is more intuitive, though I recognize
that basically everyone has gotten used to the number row. I hold
down one key with my left thumb, and I'm in my symbols layer. Then
I can type all the numbers I want, and when I release that key,
I'm back to typing letters.

The other keyboard feature that I like a lot is having arrow keys
right where my left hand naturally rests. I have gotten used to
using WASD playing many games, but when I was making the keymap, I
realized that while typing, my hand naturally rests on ESDF, which
I still think of as WASD, just shifted over one key. This way,
when I'm in my navigation layer, I don't have to move my left hand
over a key to get to the arrow keys.

If you're still with me, one of the final cool keyboard layer
features I designed was how to move between the layers. Most split
keyboards come with a layer shifting feature that works like a
shift button. While that key is held down, you are in the layer.
This is very intuitive and useful, but after watching
[[https://www.youtube.com/c/BenVallack][Ben Vallack's YouTube channel]],
I saw that he was trying to avoid “chording”, which is where
you press multiple keys at once. So I made a second way to access
the layers. The first way is to hold down space. Space on the left
side takes you to the symbols and numbers layer. Space on the
right side takes you to the arrow keys and function keys layer.
The second way is to tap the button next to space. When you tap
it, it will take you to the layer for one keypress. This is
useful, for example, when you want to hit a function key at a
specific time. You can tap the button next to space and know that
your keyboard will interpret the next keypress as that layer. But
now, what if you want to stay in that layer? If you tap the button
a second time, it'll keep you in the layer. A third key has been
programmed to always take you to the alphabet layer, no matter
what layer you are on, and when you are on the alphabet layer, it
does nothing. This way, if I need to do a lot of arrow key
movements, I can double tap my layer switch key, do the movements,
and if I want to go home, I can tap the alphabet layer key. I
think that this system is pretty intuitive, and better than if the
key took you to the layer and the same key took you back home.
There is minimal visual feedback with this keyboard, and you often
want to be very sure you know what keys you are pressing. If you
followed all of that, good for you! This system is not perfect,
and I'm still thinking of ways to improve it, but I've been using
it for the past few weeks and enjoy it. I hadn't seen any keyboard
layouts that did something similar online, and I researched
multiple before starting to make my own. My keyboard files are
available on my
[[https://github.com/emdashii/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/emdashiiAnimation][github]].

This is my updated keymap. I changed how the layers are accessed a
bit, to make the navigation layer more prominant. I also added a
few keys that I ended up needed. This is the 8th varient of this
keymap, but I think it'll be the last. I'm currently working on a
new keymap that uses more layers, to put frequently used keys in
easy to reach spots. Also, this keymap is totally full. I wanted
more keys, and I figured I may as well redesign it from the ground
up. When I have the new keymap working, I'll add it to this
website. :)

Also, the fourth layer is specifically for
playing Minecraft :P

[[/split-keyboard/crkbdV8-1.jpg]]

There are many options. If you already have mechanical key
switches and caps, the cheapest is probably to build your own.
This would cost around $30 (if you have a 3D printer) to $80 (if
you don't). If you just want to assemble the parts and not do any
soldering, expect to pay around $200. You can also sometimes find
split keyboards on esty or ebay around that price. For a fully
assembled professionally made one, expect to pay anywhere from
$250-up. The
[[https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/][ZSA Moonlander]]
is well regarded and has very customizable software. If you want
one that is sculpted to your hand, look for the
[[https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/][Kinesis Advantage2]]
or a
[[https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard][Dactyl Manuform]].
These get more pricey. If you want fewer keys, look for a
[[https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep][Ferris Sweep]]
or
[[https://github.com/foostan/crkbd][crkbd Corne]],
 like I have. There are almost infinite variations of split
keyboards that people have come up with. Some have tenting built
in, and others don't. Some have
[[https://github.com/greyhatmiddleman/crkbd-pimoroni-trackball][a]]
[[https://github.com/Bastardkb/Charybdis][trackball]]
or a
[[https://github.com/joric/jorne/wiki/Trackpoint][trackpoint]]
built into the keyboard. I'd like to build one of those and see
how I like it, because it would mean that I would have to reach
for the mouse less than I already do.

** mazzaella? elliott?

[[/images/mazz.jpg]]

** why mazzaella?

First, what is Mazzaella? Mazzaella is a genus of a species of
seaweed. See [[https://www.seaweedsofalaska.com/species.asp?SeaweedID=224][this]] article. Why did I choose the domain name
Mazzaella? Because it reminds me of home, the Pacific Northwest.
/Mazzaella splendens/ is a beautiful red seaweed. When you
view it underwater, it shimmers.

The photo above is a picture I took of what I hope is of
/Mazzaella splendens/. It looks similar to it, but the
iridescence did not show up on camera, so I'm not one hundred
percent sure.

** why am I?

 I, Elliott Claus, am. I grew up on a small island in the Pacific
Ocean, Orcas Island, WA. I went to college at Walla Walla
University and graduated in 2020 with a Bioengineering degree. I
worked a summer construction job through high school and college,
and for a bit afterwards. I recently moved to Georgia, as I
accepted a junior developer role at AppVizo. I am good at making
things happen while keeping cost, time, and quality in mind. You
can only have two, but I try to optimize as best I can.

For fun, I like to play board games, pickleball, and ride my
electric unicycle. For entertainment, I default to Twitter and
YouTube. For society, I mostly spend time with my family and close
friends.

** Designing and manufacturing a DIY Photometer

[[/photometer/photometer.jpg]]

[[/photometer/PCB-V1.4.jpg]]

** Photometer and custom PCB

*** What is a photometer?

A photometer is a device that measures the transmission of light
  through a liquid, from which you can calculate properties of the
  liquid. The photometer that I designed measures the pH of
  seawater.

  *** Abstract

  Many professional biologists are doing ocean acidification
  research, but this requires expensive machinery to monitor pH
  levels accurately. This project's goal is to make an accessible
  and accurate DIY photometer to measure ocean pH, with the goal
  of it being used in high school classrooms. This photometer is
  upgraded from a design by Yang et al. in their paper, “Seawater
  PH Measurements in the Field: A DIY Photometer with 0.01 Unit PH
  Accuracy.” The main improvements involve simplifying the
  building process using a custom printed circuit board (PCB),
  having clear building instructions and usage procedures, adding
  a third LED to make the measurements more accurate, and updating
  code to calculate the pH on the device. After testing, this DIY
  photometer design successfully meets the +/- 0.01 pH precision,
  while being simple and cost effective to build. The total cost
  is around $80.

** projects overview

*** coding projects

**** Junior Developer at [[https:appvizo.com/][AppVizo]]

**** Started February 2022 | Projects I've worked on:

Note from future me: My junior role ended when I took a fulltime position at BenefitFirst September 2022.

*** Movement Measures.

This project was written using C# and WPF.

wrote a program in C# using WPF

**** Project Intro:

This client asked for a desktop app that could overlay any zoom or
other type of conference call. Physical therapists are doing more
of their work online, and as part of that, they need to measure
angles to see if a client is improving in flexibility. This is
especially difficult over zoom. Physical therapists had been using
protractors on the computer screen to get angles.

**** What I did:

What I did: I built a wpf app that lets you place and drag three
points, and displays the angle between the points. This was my
first project during my internship at AppVizo. The client was
happy with this, and has asked for more work, so he can get a
patent. I am currently adding features that will make the app
patentable.

*tl;dr* I wrote a WPF app for a physical therapy client.

**** Skills demonstrated:

- Working with clients
- App design sessions
- Code reviews
- Building a WPF app, using C# and XAML

*** Kraken ServiceNow

This project was written in JavaScript, inside ServiceNow.

wrote javascript scripts to edit servicenow records

**** Project Overview:

ServiceNow is a behemoth platform. They provide templates to
create enterprise apps, mostly for detailing organizations.
AppVizo was contracted to build a networking app. This app tracks
and details people, events, equipment, and connections between
everything. It provides a detailed picture of the organization, so
if something goes wrong, a user can find the problem and fix it
easily. It tracks the status of networking equipment, and the
connections between different pieces of equipment.

As part of building this application on the ServiceNow platform,
we put in dummy data, so that the client can see what it would
look like if they were using the application. This dummy data
included multiple sites, each of which consisted of buildings,
which contain rooms (specifically server rooms), which contain
racks, which contain networking equipment. Every server and router
communicates with at least one piece of the network. Each is
powered redundantly. All this is modeled in the ServiceNow app.

**** What I did:

A lot of what I did involved entering data. ServiceNow provides a
couple of ways to enter data. One is to format an excel document
to be precisely the way they will recognize it, and then upload
it. This way, unfortunately, does not allow for any connections
between different pieces of data. So instead, ServiceNow has an
Xplore page, where you can write JavaScript (in ES5) that can
access and update tables in their database. With this method, you
can call up two different tables, and find specific items in each
to reference in a third table.

For example, say you have a router and a server that are linked.
You could search the router table, the server table, and then link
them in the CMDB, which is a specific third table. In the linking,
you can specify which port and IP address each uses. That way, if
something goes wrong with the server, you can easily look up where
it gets its data, and find fixes easier.

With Javascript, I have probably made over five thousand
records/changes to records in AppVizo's ServiceNow developer
instance. Some of these were creating records from scratch and
generating random data. Some of these, the data was already
generated, and I had to enter it in a way where every record
connected to the correct thing.

*tl;dr* I wrote lots of JavaScript to update ServiceNow's
database.

**** Skills demonstrated:

- Detailed data entry
- Understanding a complex network
- ServiceNow server calls using GlideRecords
- Referencing different types of elements using JavaScript
- Code base: JavaScript ES5

*** P1Moto
This project involved code refactoring in Python.
refactored a client's python codebase

**** Project Overview:

AppVizo had previously written a webscraper for this client. It
scraped a website, edited the returned data, and then outputted a
csv file. This ran daily on a server. The client added
functionality, scraping multiple other websites. This added
complexity, until it was difficult to tell what part of the
program did what. There were multiple files hundreds of lines of
code long. Some of them were redundant, but it was unclear what
was actually used and important.

The client came back to AppVizo and asked for additional
functionality, scraping another website, as well as combining all
the different scrapes into a single file. (Each one was outputting
a separate csv file.)

**** What I did:

I read through all the current code and figured out what each
piece did, and which pieces were copies of functions from other
files. I added a

            ~def main()~

and

~if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()~

to each file, and then called the relevant ones from a main.py
file. This added clarity to what ran when.

One of the other programmers added SQLite to the program. After
that was done, I added that functionality to all the other files,
so that everything outputted to a SQLite file, which at the end
put out a single csv file. This helped the code to run faster, and
made it easier to debug if any of the web scrapes failed. It also
helped to format each scrape into a similar data format, which the
client needed.

*tl;dr* Refactored a client's python code and added
additional functionality using pandas and SQLite.

**** Skills demonstrated:

- Managing complexity as projects get bigger and expand in scope
- Refactoring an existing codebase
- Python pandas and SQLite integration
- Working with a client when what they ask for requires more work than they realize
- Working with other programmers, integrating other people's code
- Git: merging, branches, and pull/push
- Code base: Python

** counterpoint sheet music generator

using c++ and lilypond

*** What is counterpoint and why does it make a good candidate for using code to generate music?

Counterpoint is a specific style of music, where one melody is
generated based on the note that came before, using specific
rules. This means that if you can write a melody, the program can
write a counterpoint to go along with it.

[[/lilypond/image1.png]]

These images are from Burstein, L. Poundie., and Joseph Nathan.
Straus.
/Concise Introduction to Tonal Harmony./
W.W. Norton, 2016. The top image demonstrates a counterpoint
melody, and the numbers represent the intervals between the notes.
The bottom image shows some of the rules for what counterpoint
melodies cannot do.

** What were the requirements and challenges for this project?

*** Writing Music:

- Translating music theory to code
- Saving music notes
- Using logic to check for errors
- Deciding which part of the program does what

*** Exporting sheet music:

- Understanding basic music rules
- Integrating with LilyPond
- Exporting different lengths
- Exporting in different keys
- Exporting with difrferent time signatures

** Proejct details:

This program was written in C++, and was designed to export text
that fit the .ly file format. Here is the class hierarchy diagram.

[[/lilypond/image2.png]]

The goal for this project is to build a program that generates
correct two-voice counterpoint.

This project has four distinct parts: a note class, a
class/function that combines all the rules, classes of rules, and
a class/function that outputs a .ly file.

*** Key Features

- User chooses length, time signature, and species type
- Follows all the rules for counterpoint
- Outputs a LilyPond file with the generated music

*** Assumptions

- The users are good actors
- The user will not want to write counterpoint in a minor key
- The user cannot choose what specific notes they want

Note: Caleb N. and I worked on this project together.

The code still runs, though there are now build errors. I ran it,
and this is what the program looked like:

[[/lilypond/image3.png]]

 It created a file, which, once I found it, imports into LilyPond
correctly and plays. You can copy the outputted text and put it
into hacklily.org (also linked below) to see the sheet music. I
generated the first two phrases in style 0, then in style 1, then
style 2, then finally style 0 again.

Here is the first bit
of the output:

[[/lilypond/image4.png]]

I am very impressed that it still runs. It looks like there are
some notes for which the logic may be wrong, given the large jumps
up and down occasionally, and when I listened to it I heard at
least one major second, which I don't think should be there (the
last note in measure five). Still, I haven't looked at this code
in three years, and I'm kinda impressed with my past self. What a
cool project xD

I uploaded all the project files to
[[https://github.com/emdashii/counterpoint_generator][github]],
as they were being hosted somewhere else, so at least I'll have
a copy of the code.

Here is a bonus image of what the program looked like when it ran:

** idea: calculate all the lengths you can have with fixed length suspension

*** suspension lengths combined

this page is a calculator for idea seven of the image below (sorry
for the bad quality). i tried three times to make a UCR
suspension, but i think i got cheap UHMWPE rope and it was too
slippery. so i looked up many suspension ideas and then iterated
on iterlocking loops.

[[/images/hammock_suspension.png]]

the reason that i like the loops is that there is no chance for
them to let me down (assuming i made them correctly). i connect
them together by sliding one through the other. calculating how
much adjustibility i could get with four loops was difficult, so i
made this page to run the calculation for me.

if you want to know what the options are without folding a loop
(idea four), then put a number bigger than half of your biggest
loop in "minimum fold lenght". the "dogbone" vs "continuous loop"
and "minimum bury lenght" are there to calculate the total rope
needed for the suspension.

*** conclusions???

an interesting thing about the numbers i ended up with is that
there is no way to get the same length using two different
combinations of rope, as long as the minimum fold length is big
enough that the two smallest lengths cannot be folded. (though now
that i'm thinking about it, this may not be a special propery, as
long as you don't double or quadruple your lengths)

the other interesting thing is that i built this suspension, and
used it once. then i realized what a hassel it was to set it up,
and i bought a $5 set of non-ratcheting straps, cut off the ends,
and used a beckett hitch to tie off. and it works great! classic
case of overthinking a problem when a $5 solution exists.

:END:

** create the noose

1. start with at least 20-30 inches of braided rope. fold your it in half.

  [[/soft-shackle/noose1.jpg]]

2. about two thickness of the rope from the middle, split the strands in half, so that there are the same number of strands on either side. (note: the number of strands on each side is important. count them to be sure there are the same number.)

  [[/soft-shackle/noose2.jpg]]

3. near the end of the longer side, fold the rope in half and poke it through the hold you just made.

  [[/soft-shackle/noose3.jpg]]

4. continue pulling it through until you are left with a small loop.

  [[/soft-shackle/noose4.jpg]]

5. you have created the noose. align both ends before starting the next step.

** tie the button knot

1. it helps a lot if you have a small clamp to hold the rope in place while you work. if not, take some tape and put it around the strands where you want to tie the knot. (note: it is much easier to tie the knot with too much rope and adjust it afterwards. much easier to do that than to tie it in the right spot with just enough rope.)

  [[/soft-shackle/button1.jpg]]

2. this is the part of the guide where someone else's instructions will be *much* better. each part of this knot is symmetrical, and these photos show you what it looks like after you do both sides of the symmetrical steps. [[https://www.animatedknots.com/stopper-loop-knot][these]] are the instructions that i used to learn to tie the button knot.

   [[/soft-shackle/button2.jpg]]

3. tie a two strand wall knot.

  [[/soft-shackle/button3.jpg]]

4. tie a half knot. this will be what you pass the tails through on the last step.

  [[/soft-shackle/button4.jpg]]

5. look at the picture carefully and copy it. this is the most difficult step to explain, but once you understand it, it becomes simple. nothing changed from the image above to the image below other than tightening the knot.

  [[/soft-shackle/button5.jpg]]

6. open the half knot. again nothing changed with the knot, but see how i opened the middle of the knot to make space for the tails to go down.

  [[/soft-shackle/button6.jpg]]

7. pass the tails through the holes, one on either side of the center of the knot. after you tuck the tails through those holes and clean up the knot, it will look like this:

  [[/soft-shackle/bury1.jpg]]

here is a photo of the top of the knot, if you tied it correctly. one of the ways to tell if you tied it correctly is that
everything is symmetrical. another is that if you follow a strand, it should go under two other strands, pop out, then
under under two strands, pop out, and so on for four times.

[[/soft-shackle/top.jpg]]

** burying the tails

1. before you bury the tails, tighten the knot. i like to do this by hanging from the soft shackle (close it and put my body weight on it, using the noose to pull the knot tight), or by using pliers to pull each strand of the knot tight.

   [[/soft-shackle/bury1.jpg]]

2. when your soft shackle looks like the above image, then you are ready to begin. to do the bury, i use a thin wire wrapped around cardboard.

   [[/soft-shackle/bury5.jpg]]

3. thin the ends of the tails. there are many ways to do this, but go about an inch up from the end and cut half the strands. (you can also thin in two places for a more gradual reduction in diameter, which is better to get full strength out of the rope.)

  [[/soft-shackle/bury2.jpg]]

4. push open the braid and feed the wire in, around where the wire is in the previous photo. depending on your size of rope, you will need a different distance past the ends of the tails. for this rope i go about an inch past.

  [[/soft-shackle/bury3.jpg]]

5. once you fish the wire through, push it out as close to the knot as you can. put the end of one of the tails through the wire, and fold it back on itself.

  [[/soft-shackle/bury4.jpg]]

6. bury the tail by pulling the wire (with the tail in the end of it) through the braid and out again. when it comes out, tug on it with pliers to make sure it is all the way in and there is no bunching.

  [[/soft-shackle/bury6.jpg]]

7. milk the bury (this is the most satisfying part!). from the button knot, unbunch the rope by sliding your fingers down it. if you did it corrently, the tails should be completely inside of the braid. if not, unbury them and enter the braid lower next time.

** soft shackle!

I've had a lot of fun this year learning new knots. Making soft shackles was one of the things I learned this year, and I enjoy
 making them as gifts to give to others, as well as for myself. I most frequently use them to put up tarps and on the end of my hammocks.

Soft shackles can have many knots at the end. I particularly like to make them with a button knot, but you can do a diamond knot or a double overhand knot.
(In fact, if you tie the double overhand knot correctly, it can be close to as strong as the button knot. See [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU_mmdbQeCQ][this video]].)
A button knot is similar to a diamond knot, except that it does not slip as easily, particularly in dyneema (UHMWPE). The button knot takes
a bit of practice to learn to tie, but it is a beautiful knot.

** what is a soft shackle?

Think of it like a carabiner (except made of rope). To use it, widen the noose (the loop at the end), remove the button knot from the noose,
 wrap the cord part around two things, and then put the noose back over the button knot.

 ** why are soft shackles great?

 Soft shackles are incredible, particularly because they are much stronger for the weight compared to a carabiner.
 They can be tri-loaded without losing strength. If you need more strength, you can wrap it around twice. You cannot cross-load a soft shackle.
 They are very handy for connecting two (or more) static things together.
 A soft shackle can be very quick to make, if you need to just connect two things together. Tie a knot in the end of a loop of rope,
 flip a larks head into the loop side, and put it over the knot. These are great for quick soft shackles, especially out of paracord, but
 I enjoy making them out of dyneema.

  ** how are they frequently used?

They are common in vehicle recovery kits, because if something breaks and goes flying, the rope is soft, compared to a
  metal bow shackle. They are common in sailing for the same reason. I first heard about soft shackles from the [[https://www.youtube.com/@HowNOT2][HowNOT2 YouTuble channel]] , where they
  are used for rigging highlines, as well as to test other gear,
 because when made with a thicker rope, they are stronger than almost all climbing and rescue parts (over 100 kn breaking strength).

 ** how strong are soft shackles?

 When the noose is closed around the button knot, there are effectively two strands of rope going around whatever objects are being held together,
 which doubles the breaking strength of the soft shackle compared to the strength of the rope it is made of.
 Knots typically reduce the strength of the rope, but the button knot does not! (Why is this knot so strong? I'd love to write about it, but I think Allen Edwards
  did a good job of it at the link below, if you're curious.) A diamond knot soft shackle will have roughly 170% of the original line strength.
  Button knot soft shackles break at roughly 230% of the line strength. (Numbers from [[https://l-36.com/high_strength_soft_shackle.php][l-36.com]])
  So, soft shackles are very strong!

  ** how to tie a soft shackle?

  I wrote about it [[/posts/soft-shackle-how-to][here]], though there are many better guides on the internet, such as [[https://www.animatedknots.com/stopper-loop-knot][this]] one.

** are there any downsides to using a soft shackle?

Not many, but there are a few. First, they cannot take as much abrasion as a carabiner. Second, you cannot undo them if they are under load.
Third, they are more fiddly than a carabiner. But I think that all the upsides outweight the downsides. They are much cheaper than carabiners (if you make them yourself),
they are stronger and lighter, and you can make them the exact size that you need for a specific situation.

** Split keyboard keymap, revisited. (2023)

(written in 2023)

I have previously written about my split keyboard, why I use it, how it works, and the thinking behind
why I planned it the way it is. That post is [[/posts/split-keyboard-v1][here]].

In the last year and a half, I have enjoyed using the split keyboard, and used it almost every day. At some
point, I realized that I wanted it to be smaller. I felt like I could relatively easily reduce the number of
keys by six, removing the rows on the outside of the pinky. This is because I have traveled with my keyboard
a lot. It's certainly easier than a full sized keyboard, and gives me the benefits of one, but my carrying case
for it is like a 9x6x3 inch cube. Also, I wanted to reduce the number of keys as a challenge, and to better
utilize the keys that I had. So in July, 2023 I designed a 36 key keymap. It uses home row mods, and modifiers on the thumb keys.

I tried to keep everything as easy to use as possible. In my brain, the best way to do this is to trade a mental
map of physical locations for a metal map of layers. I experimented with the idea of tapping a key to take me to
another layer, but it turned out that I rarely used that, and so my layers are accessed by holding down a key. I
think of my keyboard in two main sections, the finger keys (everything except the thumbs) and the thumb keys. (Yes,
I realize thumbs are fingers too, but I mentally separate them. If I really wanted to be efficient about putting
most used keys where it is easiest to tap, I would leave QWERTY in the dust and also put some of the most used letters on the thumbs.)

*** The Thumb Keys

In the same way that the home row mods are mirrored between hands, I did that with the layer switching on the
thumbs. When held down, the furthest from center thumb key takes you to the function layer. The next takes you
to the navigation layer. The closest to the center takes you to the number layer. When you tap the keys, they
(mostly) do not mirror across the hands. From left to right, here are the tapped thumb keys used: LH: (delete, tab,
enter,) RH: (enter, space, backspace). I found I only typed space with my right thumb, and so removed the space key.
I rarely type enter with my right thumb, so that is a space for future improvement. I realized that sometimes I do
need to space or backspace with my left thumb, and tab or delete with my right thumb, so I added a "keymap" for the
thumbs (actually it's part of the navigation layer, but I think of it as a separate thing), which can be accessed by
holding down the E or X key. This keymap mirrors the tap function of the thumb keys, so you can type space or
backspace with the left hand. (This is useful when your right hand is on a mouse, which I still do frequently. I haven't
graduated to the full keyboard lifestyle yet.)

*** The Finger Keys

**** Layer 0 (QWERTY)

[[/split-keyboard/corne36/layer1.png]]

At one point, I tried having lots of layers, with each dedicated to something specific, and many blank keys. I
was thinking that I could use tapping of thumb keys to quickly travel between lots of layers, but it turned out
this was just confusing. Also, once I removed the six outer keys, I didn't have the thumb keys available to use
for tapping. So I condensed my layers and now access them by holding down keys. I don't type fast enough that the
200ms delay to access a layer bothers me (and obviously you can customize this delay to be longer or shorter).
With this approach, I have four main layers and two rarely used layers. (Those are a dedicated gaming layer and
an adjustment layer.) The keyboard stays on the QWERTY layer most of the time, which is a full sized QWERTY layout.
It also has the delete, tab, enter, space, and backspace keys accessible on the thumbs by tapping. Then when you
hold keys down, the home row becomes windows, alt, shift, and ctrl, mapped to a, s, d, f, and that is mirrored for
the right hand. (ctrl, shift, alt, windows on j, k, l, and ;). I've already described how the thumb keys work.

**** Layer 1 (Navigation)

[[/split-keyboard/corne36/layer2.png]]

On the navigation layer, the left hand has the arrow keys (e s d f) and page up, page down, home, and end. It also
has the `, ', and " keys on the pinky. (This has worked way better than I thought it would, since I was used to using
my right pinky for the ' and " keys.) The right hand has a dedicated ctrl, shift, alt, and gui/windows key on the home
row, for combining with the arrow keys for shortcuts. Then it also has insert, escape, and the ^, &, *, +, ~, and _.
(These didn't fit on my number/symbol layer)

**** Layer 2 (Numbers/Symbols)

[[/split-keyboard/corne36/layer4.png]]

On the number/symbol layer, I have the numbers arranged in a numpad layout for the right hand. Around it I have the
symbols related to math and time, *, =, :, +, -, /, ., 0. For the left hand, I have the brackets with the open bracket
on the home row, and the corresponding close bracket right underneath it, ordered like this: (, <, {, [. I found that
most programs where I type brackets, it will auto type the close bracket for me, so I just put the open one on the home
row. Then I have the 1-5 shifted keys above, !, @, #, $, and %. Lastly, I included the \ and | keys. So it's like LH symbols, RH numbers.

**** Layer 3 (Function/Mouse)

[[/split-keyboard/corne36/layer5.png]]

On the function/mouse layer, for the left hand I put the mouse keys. I rarely use these, but technically I don't need a
mouse at all. I can do most window navigation with shortcuts, and eventually I may like to get rid of the mouse, but for
now I still use it a ton. The left hand has all the function keys, arranged in a numpad format, and then the column to the
right of them has F10, F11, and F12 going down. That's pretty much it for that layer.

**** Layer 4 (Gaming) and Layer 5 (Adjustment)

[[/split-keyboard/corne36/layer3.png]]

[[/split-keyboard/corne36/layer6.png]]

These two layers are less interesting, but I am posting the screenshots of them for my own future reference. (Note: Technically layer 4 is actually layer 2, but that is for layer switching purposes.)

** TOTEM Keyboard and beyond (2024)

(written in 2024)

In spring of this year, I finally bit the bullet and fully built a custom keyboard. I built the [[https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM][TOTEM]], which has 38 keys.
I updated my keymaps to be less theoretical and more useful. And finally, I have a solution to be able to type on my keyboard
away from my keyboard, which is a program called Kanata.

*** TOTEM Build

[[/split-keyboard/totem/totemWireless.jpg]]

My wireless TOTEM keyboard.

Building the TOTEM was a lot of fun! I was debating between building a TOTEM and building the Charybdis Nano, which has curved
keywells and a trackball built into the right hand near the thumb. I settled on the TOTEM because it is much smaller, and will
travel better. Also, being a 38 key keyboard, it has one extra key on each side for the pinky, which I thought might be useful
(extra compared to a 36 key Corne keyboard, which I think is the standard 36 key layout). The TOTEM also uses low profile switches,
and is designed to be as thin as possible. You can build it in a wired or wireless version. I love the idea of my mouse being
integrated into my keyboard, and I like the trackball, but after having used both finger and thumb trackballs, I like the finger
ones much better. My thumb ends up being sore after a few weeks of the thumb ball, whereas the finger ones have not had that issue
for me. Also because the Charybdis has a trackball, it cannot be wireless, and I really wanted to try a wireless keyboard.

[[/split-keyboard/totem/totemPCB.jpg]]

I ordered all the parts and the PCBs, and got to work building it! Here are a few tips that I remember from my time building:

1. Don't put it in the case too early. The keys are much more difficult to pull from their sockets once they are in the case, and this cost me
  much time, as I kept thinking everything was put together, but I had errors somewhere.

2. Use flux! Especially when connecting the Seeed XIAO microcontroller to the PCB. On almost all of my boards, I did not get enough solder to make the connection (like it was
  physically touching and so it worked), but when things shifted, then my keyboard would stop working. So I had to take it apart again
  and find where I did something wrong.

3. Be careful with the on/off switch on the BLE version. On one of my boards, it wasn't charging because the on/off switch was broken. I tried to replace it and damaged the PCB, leading to the board working if it was plugged in, but
  not from the battery. On the other board, I wasn't careful turning it on/off, and broke the switch in the on position. This isn't the
  worst, as it lasts around a month on battery power, and has an auto-standby mode, but it's annoying.

[[/split-keyboard/totem/totemWiredPinks.jpg]]

My wired TOTEM keyboard.

I built two TOTEM keyboards, a wired and wireless version. When ordering parts, most of the cost is in shipping, so going from one board
to two added $20 in parts, not counting switches. (Ordering switches for this board is annoying, because it uses the choc v1 switches and
they have moved on to the v2, and it has 38 keys. I found packs of 36 switches, which meant that I was two switches short.) Because of the
aforementioned issues with the wireless keyboard build, I have been enjoying the wired version better, especially since both need to be
plugged in. May as well have the latency gains and not need to worry about the bluetooth connectivity issues.

*** Keymap Updates

When re-thinking through my keymap to add the extra pinky key to it, I ended up keeping most things the same, but changed how I switch layers.
I realized the 80% of the time I am on my alpha layer, then the remaining 15% of the time I am on my symbols/nav layer, then 4% of the time I
am on my numbers/function keys layer, and finally 1% of the time I am in the adjustment layer. So, the thumb keys now only move me to the symbol/nav
layer, and the pinky keys to the numbers/function keys layer, and a combo of both of those to the adjustment layer. There were a few keys on the
number layer that I used more frequently, specifically the =, +, and - keys. Here is where I got clever xD I started using key combos for the first
time. I had not wanted to try to figure out key combos before, but it turns out that they are pretty easy in both ZMK and QMK. I put the = symbol
on j and k, + on k and l, and - on l and ; keys. (and for a bonus, ~ on j and l) Then I added a few other combos while I was at it, of which I use
ESC on q and w the most. I switched from having the arrow keys on e s d f to be on h j k l, to match the VIM layout. (This is because maybe someday
I'll want to try VIM, and if I'm use to that arrow key layout, it'll make the transition much easier, I hope.) Oh, I also moved my row of `, ', and
“ to my nav layer on the left hand. These changes enabled me to use my number layer much more infrequently, and makes it much easier to type these symbols.

The thing that I did that has not been useful is adding a “repeat” key. I was thinking that a repeat key would be useful when typing double-lettered
words. So I could type the first letter, then hit repeat, and wouldn't have to tap that key again. Turns out I barely use the key. The other experiment
I added was putting a shift for one word key on my pinky. This has worked out slightly better, because I'm not great at typing out a whole word properly
switching which shift key I hit. I am good at using the shift on the opposite side from where I'm typing, but because shift is on my middle finger, it
blocks the d and k keys, depending on which hand is holding down the key.

[[/split-keyboard/totem/layer0.png]]

- Layer 0 (QWERTY)

[[/split-keyboard/totem/layer1.png]]

- Layer 1 (Navigation/Symbols)

[[/split-keyboard/totem/layer3.png]]

- Layer 2 (Numbers/Function)

[[/split-keyboard/totem/layer4.png]]

- Layer 3 (Adjustment)

These photos are from the ZMK layout, but I copied it over to a QMK layout for both the TOTEM and the Corne. The photos are missing all the
secondary functions when you tap and hold a key, as well as the key combos.

[[/split-keyboard/totem/layer0wMods.png]]

That's what the layers look like if you also visualize the home row mods, but I think it's more confusing if you don't know what you're looking at.
I got the image from a [[https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/][ZMK Keymap Editor]] with a GUI, which was very handy to help me learn ZMK and copy over my QMK keymap.

*** And Beyond! (Kanata)

Since switching to the TOTEM keyboard, I have not used any tenting features. Not that I don't like them, but I have been packing up my keyboard every
day, and getting the keyboard tenting set nicely takes more time to configure than just laying the keyboard flat. This led to me typing on my laptop
keyboard more, which led to me missing the home row mods and alternate layers when using my laptop. Enter [[https://github.com/jtroo/kanata][Kanata]].

Kanata is a program that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and basically is able to give all the features of custom keyboard firmware on a normal
keyboard. I created a Kanata keymap that emulates most of my normal keymap, except that it only has two layers. One for home-row-mods and combos,
and the other for navigation and symbols. You access the second layer by holding down space. The only other key I changed was making the key right
next to space (on my keyboard alt) into a tab key, so I can hit tab with my thumb. (Conceptually, combos are much more confusing to program in
Kanata than in ZMK or QMK). If you want to try my keymap and experience the magic of home row mods, you can now do it with no change to your
physical hardware! Just copy my Kanata keymap and save it with a .kbd extension. (You can download a github plugin to get text highlighting and
basic error checking on these files, if you want to edit the file later). Then, go to Kanata's releases and download the most recent version. (I
am currently using a prerelease of v1.7.0, which has a kanata_gui.exe that runs in the background on windows, which is nice.) Now, Kanata does not
play nice with my split keyboard, so I don't have it start on boot, but that's definitely something that you can do if you want to.

** Conclusion

I first wrote about keyboards in July of 2022. Now it's October of 2024, over two years later, and I'm still loving the split keyboard life.
I don't think I've gone off the deep end too much xD. I have four boards, two Corne's and two TOTEM's. I got to build both TOTEM's from scratch,
which was a joy! And now, even if I'm away from my split keyboard, I can still use the main features of it on any keyboard, thanks to Kanata.
